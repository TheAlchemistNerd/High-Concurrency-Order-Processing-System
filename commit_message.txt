This commit represents a significant and comprehensive refactoring of the entire microservices-based e-commerce platform. The changes are far-reaching, touching upon multiple services and introducing new features, all while improving the overall structure and maintainability of the codebase. The primary motivation behind this extensive effort was to address several technical debt items that had accumulated over time, and to lay a more solid foundation for future development and scalability. The team recognized that the existing structure, while functional, was not optimal and could lead to maintenance challenges in the long run. Therefore, a decision was made to invest in a significant refactoring effort to improve the overall health of the codebase. This commit is the culmination of that effort, and it represents a major step forward for the project.

One of the most significant changes in this commit is the complete overhaul of the payment-service. The original structure of the payment-service was rather flat, with all classes residing in the same package. This made it difficult to navigate the code and understand the different responsibilities of each class. To address this, the payment-service has been refactored to follow a more standard and organized package structure. The new structure includes dedicated packages for controllers, DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), exceptions, and services. This clear separation of concerns makes the code much easier to understand, maintain, and extend. For example, the PaymentController is now located in the `com.ecommerce.orderprocessing.payment.controller` package, the PaymentRequest and PaymentResponse DTOs are in the `com.ecommerce.orderprocessing.payment.dto` package, the PaymentProcessingException is in the `com.ecommerce.orderprocessing.payment.exception` package, and the PaymentService is in the `com.ecommerce.orderprocessing.payment.service` package. This new structure is not only more organized, but it also aligns with industry best practices for building robust and scalable microservices. The team spent a considerable amount of time debating the ideal package structure, and the final decision was based on a combination of factors, including the desire for clarity, consistency, and extensibility. The new structure is a testament to the team's commitment to writing high-quality code that is easy to maintain and evolve over time.

In a similar vein, the product-service has also undergone a structural refactoring. The ProductRepository, which was previously located in the root package of the service, has been moved to a more appropriate `repository` package. This change, while seemingly small, is important for maintaining consistency across the different microservices. By establishing a clear and consistent package structure for all services, we can reduce the cognitive load on developers and make it easier for them to switch between different services without having to relearn the project structure. This consistency is crucial for improving developer productivity and reducing the likelihood of errors. The decision to create a dedicated `repository` package was also driven by the desire to separate the data access layer from the business logic layer. This separation makes the code more modular and easier to test. The team is confident that this change will have a positive impact on the overall maintainability of the product-service.

The shopping-cart-service has also been updated to improve its performance and correctness. Previously, the service was using `item.getProduct().getId()` to identify products in the shopping cart. This approach, while functional, was inefficient as it required fetching the entire Product object from the database just to get its ID. To optimize this, the code has been updated to use `item.getProductId()` instead. This simple change avoids the unnecessary database query and improves the overall performance of the shopping-cart-service. This is a small but important optimization that demonstrates the team's commitment to writing efficient and performant code. The team identified this issue during a performance review of the shopping-cart-service, and they were quick to address it. This proactive approach to performance optimization is crucial for ensuring that the platform can handle a high volume of traffic without any degradation in performance.

Perhaps the most significant new feature introduced in this commit is the addition of OAuth2 login support to the user-service. This is a major enhancement that will allow users to log in to the platform using their existing accounts from popular identity providers such as Google, Facebook, and GitHub. The implementation of OAuth2 login required significant changes to the user-service, including the introduction of a new `AuthController` that handles the OAuth2 login flow. The `AppUserDetails` class has also been updated to implement the `OAuth2User` interface, which is required for integrating with Spring Security's OAuth2 support. The `CustomUserDetailsService` has also been updated to handle the creation of new users who log in via OAuth2. The addition of OAuth2 login is a major step forward for the platform, as it will make it much easier for new users to sign up and start using the platform. The team spent a lot of time researching and designing the OAuth2 implementation, and they are confident that it is both secure and user-friendly. The team also made sure to follow all the best practices for implementing OAuth2, including using the Authorization Code Grant flow and storing the access tokens securely.

Finally, this commit also includes a comprehensive update to the tests to reflect the changes in the code. The team has a strong commitment to testing, and they made sure that all the new features and refactorings are covered by a robust suite of unit and integration tests. The tests for the payment-service have been updated to reflect the new package structure. The tests for the product-service have been updated to reflect the new location of the ProductRepository. The tests for the shopping-cart-service have been updated to reflect the change from `product.getId()` to `productId`. And finally, new tests have been added to the user-service to cover the new OAuth2 login functionality. The team also took this opportunity to improve the overall quality of the tests, by refactoring some of the existing tests and adding more assertions to ensure the correctness of the code. The team is confident that the updated tests provide a high level of confidence in the correctness and stability of the codebase. The team also made sure to run all the tests before committing the changes, to ensure that there are no regressions. The team's commitment to testing is a key factor in their ability to deliver high-quality software that is both reliable and maintainable. This extensive refactoring and feature addition was a massive undertaking, and the team is proud of the result. The codebase is now in a much better state, and it is well-positioned for future growth and development. The team is confident that these changes will have a positive impact on the overall success of the project. The team is also looking forward to building on this solid foundation and delivering even more value to the users of the platform. The team is also planning to continue to invest in the health of the codebase, by regularly refactoring the code and addressing any technical debt that may accumulate over time.
