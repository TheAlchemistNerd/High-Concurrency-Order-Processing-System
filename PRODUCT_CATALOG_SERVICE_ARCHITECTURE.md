# Architectural Vision: Decoupling with a Product Catalog Service

## Introduction

This document outlines a strategic architectural evolution for the e-commerce platform, transitioning from a monolithic structure towards a more scalable and maintainable microservices-oriented design. The cornerstone of this proposal is the introduction of a dedicated **Product Catalog Service**. This initiative aims to address the challenges of high coupling observed in the current architecture, where multiple services are directly dependent on shared data repositories, thereby hindering independent development, scaling, and maintenance.

## 1. Analysis of the Current Architecture

An analysis of the existing monolithic codebase reveals a high degree of coupling centered around the `Product` entity and its corresponding `ProductRepository`. Currently, at least three distinct services directly access this repository:

*   **`ShoppingCartServiceImpl`**: Accesses the `ProductRepository` to retrieve product details (e.g., price, name) when an item is added to a user's cart.
*   **`OrderServiceImpl`**: Also accesses the `ProductRepository` to validate and retrieve product information during the creation of order line items.
*   **`InventoryService`**: Is the most deeply coupled service, using the `ProductRepository` for a wide range of operations, from querying product availability to directly modifying stock levels on the `Product` entity itself.

This entanglement of responsibilities means that a simple change to the `Product` data model could necessitate coordinated changes across three separate services. Furthermore, the `InventoryService` currently performs a dual role: it manages the transactional business logic of stock levels while also serving as a query source for descriptive product data. This conflation of concerns is a classic characteristic of a monolithic design that can be improved upon.

## 2. The Role of a Dedicated Product Catalog Service

The proposed **Product Catalog Service** will serve as the single, authoritative source of truth for all descriptive product information. Its responsibilities are focused on the static or semi-static data that defines *what a product is*.

*   **Core Responsibility**: To manage the lifecycle and data of product-related information.
*   **Data Owned**:
    *   Product Name, Description, Specifications
    *   Price
    *   Images, Videos, and other media assets
    *   Categories, Tags, and other classification metadata
    *   Brand and Manufacturer information
*   **Typical API Operations**:
    *   `GET /products/{id}`: Retrieve detailed information for a single product.
    *   `GET /products`: Enable searching, filtering, and paginated browsing of products.
    *   `POST /products`, `PUT /products/{id}`, `DELETE /products/{id}`: Provide administrative endpoints for managing the catalog.

This service would be consumed by the front-end application for displaying product pages and by other services that need to retrieve product details without being coupled to the underlying data structure.

## 3. The Role of a Dedicated Inventory Service

Complementing the Product Catalog Service, the **Inventory Service** would be refactored to have a single, clear responsibility: managing the availability and stock levels of products. It answers the question of *how many* of a product are available for sale.

*   **Core Responsibility**: To provide a transactional, high-performance ledger for product stock.
*   **Data Owned**:
    *   `productId`: An identifier linking to the product in the Catalog Service.
    *   `stockQuantity`: The number of items currently on hand.
    *   `location` (Optional): The warehouse or distribution center where the stock is located.
    *   `reservations`: A list of temporary holds on stock for pending orders.
*   **Typical API Operations**:
    *   `GET /inventory/{productId}`: Check the current stock level for a product.
    *   `POST /inventory/reserve`: Atomically reserve a quantity of a product for a transaction (e.g., checkout).
    *   `POST /inventory/release`: Release a previously made reservation (e.g., cart expiration, payment failure).
    *   `POST /inventory/commit`: Decrement stock quantity upon a successful sale.
    *   `POST /inventory/restock`: Increment stock quantity for returns or new shipments.

This separation isolates the highly transactional and volatile nature of inventory data from the more static product catalog, allowing each service to be scaled and optimized independently.

## 4. Architectural Synergy with CQRS

This service-oriented decomposition provides the ideal foundation for implementing the **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)** pattern *within* each service. While service separation and CQRS are distinct concepts, their synergy is powerful.

For example, within the `ProductCatalogService`:
*   **Commands**: Administrative actions like `CreateProductCommand` or `UpdatePriceCommand` would be handled by a "write model." This model would contain rich business logic and validation, updating a primary, normalized database.
*   **Queries**: Customer-facing read requests (e.g., browsing the site) would be served by a separate, highly optimized "read model." This could be a denormalized document in a search engine like Elasticsearch, designed for extremely fast reads.

When a command is successfully processed, the write model would publish an event (e.g., `ProductPriceUpdated`), which would be used to asynchronously update the read model. This ensures that the system remains responsive to high-volume read traffic without compromising the integrity of write operations.

#### 4.1. Caching Strategies

To optimize performance and scalability for the Product Catalog Service, a multi-layered caching strategy is essential, especially given the high read-to-write ratio typical for product data.

*   **CDN Caching (for Product Images and Static Assets):**
    *   **Applicability:** Product images, videos, and other static media assets are prime candidates for Content Delivery Network (CDN) caching.
    *   **Purpose:** CDNs distribute content geographically closer to users, drastically reducing latency for media loading and offloading significant traffic from the `Product Catalog Service` and its underlying storage.
    *   **Considerations:** Implement robust cache invalidation mechanisms (e.g., versioning image URLs, explicit purges) when media assets are updated.

*   **API Gateway/BFF Caching:**
    *   **Applicability:** Frequently accessed product details (e.g., product listings, popular products, category pages) can be cached at an API Gateway or a Backend For Frontend (BFF) layer.
    *   **Purpose:** Reduces the load on the `Product Catalog Service` and its database, improving response times for common queries.
    *   **Considerations:**
        *   **Cache Invalidation:** Implement time-based expiration (TTL) or event-driven invalidation (e.g., when a product is updated, an event is published to invalidate relevant cache entries).
        *   **Cache Key Design:** Keys should be granular enough to allow efficient retrieval and invalidation (e.g., `product:id:123`, `category:electronics:page:1`).

*   **Service-Level Caching (within Product Catalog Service):**
    *   **Applicability:** The `Product Catalog Service` itself can implement an in-memory cache (e.g., Caffeine, Guava Cache) or integrate with a distributed cache (e.g., Redis) for frequently requested product objects.
    *   **Purpose:** Provides the fastest possible retrieval for hot data, further reducing database load.
    *   **Considerations:**
        *   **Consistency:** Decide on a consistency model (e.g., eventual consistency is often acceptable for product data).
        *   **Cache Eviction Policies:** Implement policies like LRU (Least Recently Used) to manage cache size.
        *   **Distributed Cache:** For a microservices environment, a distributed cache is preferred to ensure all instances of the `Product Catalog Service` share the same cached data.

*   **Client-Side Caching (Browser/Mobile App):**
    *   **Applicability:** Product details displayed on a product page or in a search result list can be cached by the client application.
    *   **Purpose:** Improves perceived performance and responsiveness for the end-user.
    *   **Considerations:** Use HTTP caching headers (Cache-Control, ETag) to guide browser caching. Implement client-side logic to refresh data when necessary.

## Conclusion

The strategic decoupling of the Product Catalog and Inventory concerns into dedicated services represents a significant step forward in the platform's architecture. This approach promises not only to resolve the immediate challenges of high coupling but also to unlock substantial long-term benefits. It will lead to a system that is more scalable, resilient, and maintainable, enabling development teams to work more autonomously and deploy features with greater speed and confidence.
